Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral with $\vert BA\vert\neq\vert BC\vert $. Denote the incircles of triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$ by $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ respectively. Suppose that there exists a circle $\omega$ tangent to the ray $BA$ beyond $A$ and to the ray $BC$ beyond $C$, which is also tangent to the lines $AD$ and $CD$. Prove that the common external tangents of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ intersect on $\omega$.
