**[CAN]** Let $R_1$, $R_2$ ... be the family of finite sequences of positive integers defined by the following rules: $R_1 = (1)$, and if $R_{nâˆ’1} = (x_1,\cdots,x_s)$, then

$$R_n = (1, 2,\cdots,x_1, 1, 2,\cdots,x_2,\cdots, 1, 2,\cdots,x_s, n)$$

For example, $R_2 = (1, 2)$, $R_3 = (1, 1, 2, 3)$, $R_4 = (1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)$.

Prove that if $n > 1$, then the $k$th term from the left in $R_n$ is equal to $1$ if and only if the $k$th term from the right in $R_n$ is different from $1$.
