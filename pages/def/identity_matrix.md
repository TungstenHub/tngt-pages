The identity matrix of order $m$ is defined as the matrix $I_m\in\mathcal{M}_{m\times m}(\K)$ having ones in the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere

$$
I_m =
\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & \cdots  & 0\\
0 & 1 & \cdots  & 0\\
\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots  & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots  & 1\\
\end{array}\right)
$$

It may also be written as $I_m=(\delta_{ij})_{ij}$, where 

$$
\delta_{ij}=
\left\{
\begin{array}{rr}
1 & \text{if \(i=j\)}\\
0 & \text{if \(i\neq j\)}\\
\end{array}\right.
$$

is known as _Kronecker's delta_
