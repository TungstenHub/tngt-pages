A set $A$ is **transitive** if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:

<ol>
<li>each element of an element of $A$ is an element of $A$</li>
<li>each element of $A$ is a subset of $A$</li>
<li>$\bigcup A\subseteq A$</li>
<li>$A \subseteq \mathcal{P}(A)$</li>
</ol>

The word _transitive_ is used because $a\in b\in A$ implying $a\in A$ reminds the transitivity in order relations. In fact, for ordinals, set membership will be an order relation
