A **representation** of a finite group $G$ on a finite-dimensional complex vector space $V$ is a homomorphism 

$$\rho: G \ll \GL(V)$$

of $G$ to the group of automorphisms of $V$

---

Such representation $\rho$ gives $V$ the structure of a $G$-module, in the sense that vectors $v\in V$ get affected by incoming elements $g\in G$

$$ G\times V \ll V $$
$$ (g,v) \maps gv \equiv \rho(g)(v) $$

It's as if more and more elements of $G$ make the vectors “spin”

$$ v \xr{g_1} g_1v \xr{g_2} g_2g_1v \xr{g_3} g_3g_2g_1v \xr{g_4} \qquad\cdots$$

The dimension of $V$ is said to be the _degree_ of $\rho$
