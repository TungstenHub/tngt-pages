A continuous map $q:(X,T)\to (X’,T’)$ is said to be a **quotient map** if 

<ol>
  <li>$q$ is surjective</li>
  <li>defining the equivalence relation in $X$ given by $x\sim y \Longleftrightarrow q(x)=q(y)$, the induced map $\bar q: (\bar X,\bar T) \to (X’,T’)$ (which is [bijective and continuous]( lem | quotient_topology )) is a homeomorphism</li>
</ol>
