A **map** $\phi$ between two representations $V$ and $W$ of $G$ is a vector space map

$$\phi: V \ll W$$

such that

$$
\begin{CD}
V @>{\phi}>> W       \\
@V{g}VV      @VV{g}V \\
V @>{\phi}>> W       \\
\end{CD}
$$

commutes for every $g\in G$ ($\phi$ is said to be _$G$-linear_)

---

If $\phi: V \ll W$ is an isomorphism, then we say we have an **isomorphism of representations**; it's the proper concept to state that two representations are "the same" but from different points of view
