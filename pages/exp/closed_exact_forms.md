Stokes' Theorem provides interesting results for special forms

<ul>
  <li>A form $\alpha$ is said to be _closed_ if its exterior derivative is zero: $\d\alpha=0$</li>
  <li>A form $\alpha$ is said to be _exact_ if it is the exterior derivative of some other form: $\alpha=\d(\beta)$</li>
</ul>

And since $\d^2=0$, exact forms are immediately closed. Moreover:

<ul>
  <li>
    A closed form always vanishes in submanifolds that are a boundary

    {{ image | integration_closed_forms }}
  </li>
  <li>
    An exact form always vanishes in closed submanifolds, no matter if they are boundary of something else

    {{ image | integration_exact_forms }}
  </li>
</ul>
