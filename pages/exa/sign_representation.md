A representation of degree 1 turns out to be a homomorphism

$$\rho: G \ll \C$$

Here we have the trivial representation $g\maps 1$, but sometimes there are other more interesting representations of degree 1

For instance, $S_n$ has the _sign representation_

$$\rho: S_n \ll \C$$
$$\sigma \maps \sgn(\sigma)\in\{+1, -1\}$$

Cool, isn't it? Which other representations of degree 1 can we find?
