The inverse of each element of a group is unique

+++
Proof
+++

Suppose two elements $y$ and $z$ are both inverses of the element $x$. Then

$$
\begin{array}{rll}
y & = ey & \qquad\text{where $e$ is the identity of the group} \\
& = (zx)y & \qquad\text{since $z$ is an inverse for $x$} \\
& = z(xy) & \qquad\text{because the multiplication is associative} \\
& = ze & \qquad\text{since $y$ is an inverse for $x$ too} \\
& = z & \qquad\text{as $e$ is the identity}
\end{array}
$$
