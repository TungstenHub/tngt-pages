Let $\K$ be a field (in general $\R$ or $\C$). A **linear equation** with coefficients in $\K$ is an expression of the form

$$a_1x_1+\cdots+a_nx_n=b$$

where $a_i$ and $b$ are known numbers in $\K$ (**coefficients** and **independent term**), and $x_i$ are the **unknowns**, for which some values in $\K$ satisfy the equation (**solutions**) and others don't

We may impose the fulfillment of not just one, but many (say $m$) linear equations: this is a **system of linear equations**

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{rrrrrrrcl}
a_{11}x_1 & + & a_{12}x_2 & + & \cdots & + & a_{1n}x_n & = & b_1\\
a_{21}x_1 & + & a_{22}x_2 & + & \cdots & + & a_{2n}x_n & = & b_2\\
 &  &  &  &  &  &  & \vdots & \\
a_{m1}x_1 & + & a_{m2}x_2 & + & \cdots & + & a_{mn}x_n & = & b_m\\
\end{array}\right.
$$

whose solutions are the values $x_i$ that satisfy the $m$ equations simultaneously
