If $M$ is a connected manifold, 

$$
H^0(M)\simeq\R\qquad H^0_c(M)
\begin{cases}
\simeq\R  & \text{if \(M\) is compact}\\
=0                & \text{if \(M\) is not compact}
\end{cases}
$$

Proof

As in the previous examples, $\text{im }\d_{-1}=0$ and $\text{ker }\d_0$ is made up by constant functions and is isomorph to $\R$, except for the compact cohomology with $M$ non-compact, in which $\text{ker }\d_0$ is also 0
	
This matches exactly the fact that $H_0(X)\simeq\mathbb{Z}$ (or $\R$, depending on the ring used) for $X$ a path-connected topological space. That is, (co-)homology of order zero represents connected components
