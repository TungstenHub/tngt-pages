Given a circle, the **inversion** is a (self-inverse!) transformation that turns the plane "inside out", and fixes the points on the circle

The formal definition is as follows: given a circle with center $O$ and radius $r$, the inverse of a point $P$ is the point $P'$ lying in the ray $OP$ and such that $OP\times OP'=r^2$
