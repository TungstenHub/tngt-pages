Differentiation behaves well with respect to sums and products with numbers

$$(aF(x)+bG(x))'=aF'(x)+bG'(x)$$

(we say it is _linear_). So integration behaves the same way: if

$$\int f(x)\dd x=F(x)+k$$
$$\int g(x)\dd x=G(x)+k$$

then

$$\int (af(x)+bg(x))\dd x=aF(x)+bG(x)+k$$

($k$ simply denotes the constant degree of freedom, so sums and products don't apply on it)
