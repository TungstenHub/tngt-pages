Inspired by the [representation of $S_n$ as permutations]( exa | representation_finite_group # sn_permutation_basis) we have the **regular representation** $R$ on any finite group $G$

Let $\C[G]$ be the vector space of formal complex-valued sums of elements of $G$:

$$\C[G] = \{a_1g_1 + \cdots + a_ng_n | a_i\in \C\}, \qquad G=\{g_1,\cdots g_n\}$$

Then we have 

$$R: G \ll \GL(\C[G])$$
$$g(a_1g_1 + \cdots + a_ng_n) = a_1gg_1 + \cdots + a_ngg_n$$

It turns out that the regular representation is of crucial importance in Representation Theory
