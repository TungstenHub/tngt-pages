Just as [we did with the sphere $\S^2$]( exa | de_rham_cohomology_s_2 ), we would like to compute the cohomology of a manifold $M$ union of smaller manifolds, say two open sets $U$, $V$. The inclusions among the different spaces induce reversed arrows for forms: one just has to restrict the forms to their new domain

{{ image | union_open_sets_injection }}

And we may gather everything up and build this chain:

{{ image | union_open_sets_injection_form_chain }}

But this chain happens to be very useful
