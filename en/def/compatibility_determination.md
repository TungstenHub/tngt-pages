According to its set of solutions, a system of linear equations is classified as

<ul>
  <li>**Incompatible** if there are no solutions</li>
  <li>
    **Compatible** if there is at least one solution
    
    <ul>
      <li>**Compatible and Determinate** if there exists exactly one solution</li>
      <li>**Compatible and Indeterminate** if there is more than one solution</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
