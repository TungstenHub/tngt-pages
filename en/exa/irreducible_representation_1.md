[{trivial_representation}]

The trivial representation

$$\rho: G \ll \GL(V)$$
$$g \maps \id_V$$

is never irreducible unless $\dim V=1$, because any subspace of $V$ is invariant under $G$

[{regular_representation}]

The [regular representation]( exp | regular_representation ) is never irreducible (unless $G$ is the trivial group): the vector

$$v = g_1 + \cdots + g_n \in \C[G]$$

is fixed under any $g\in G$ (all the $g_i$ get permuted), and the subspace spanned by $v$ is invariant
